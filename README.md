**Smart Healthcare Prediction** is a comprehensive project utilizing Data Warehousing and Data Mining (DWDM) principles combined with advanced machine learning techniques to predict health outcomes. This project employs multiple predictive models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze healthcare data and generate accurate predictions. These models are chosen for their robustness and ability to handle various types of healthcare datasets, ultimately aiding in making informed decisions and improving patient care.
